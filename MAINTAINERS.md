# Maintaining lorri

## Versioning scheme

The versioning scheme for lorri is `MAJOR.MINOR`, where `MAJOR` and `MINOR` are
non-negative integers without leading zeroes.

### Terminology

lorri is a command line tool with multiple **subcommands**. Those subcommands
are either _external_ or _internal_. _internal_ subcommands are now all grouped in `lorri internal`.
There are _mandatory_ and _optional_ **command line options**, which can be attached to the top-level command or to subcommands.

Subcommands fall into two categories based on the intended consumer of their
outputs: their **outputs** may be for _human consumption_ or
_machine-readable_.

### Major or minor release?

**Basic rule:** increment the `MAJOR` version when it is conceivable that a
user is _forced to change how they interact_ with lorri.

For example: it's a major release if since the last released version,
- for any _top-level_ command line option:
  - the command line option was removed or renamed, or
  - the command line option changed from being optional to being mandatory, or
- for any _external_ subcommand:
  - the subcommand was removed or renamed, or
  - a command line option for the subcommand was removed or renamed, or
  - a previously optional command line option for the subcommand was made
    mandatory, or
  - the subcommand has machine-readable output and the output format changed
    (\*), or
- it is conceivable that a project that could previously be built successfully
  now fails to build with lorri, unless the previous behaviour is considered a
  bug.

In any other case, increment the `MINOR` version.

(\*) The exception to this rule is `lorri direnv`: it is an external command
with machine-readable output whose output may change between minor releases,
subject to the basic rule.

A change to an _internal_ subcommand is not considered an incompatible change
and thus does not in itself necessitate a major release. This includes internal
subcommands with machine-readable output.

Since lorri is exclusively built with Nix and its runtime dependencies are
captured in its runtime closure, changing a build-time or runtime dependency
does not in itself necessitate a major release.

## Cutting a release

To cut a new release:
1. Determine if this is a [minor or major release](#versioning-scheme) and
   change the `version` field in `Cargo.toml` accordingly.
2. Build the project to update `Cargo.lock`, then run `nix/update-carnix.sh` to
   update `Cargo.nix`.
3. Create a PR with these changes and merge it. Note the hash of the merge
   commit.
4. Tag the merge commit using `git tag --sign <version> <merge commit hash>`.
   Here, `<version>` is used as the name of the tag. It should adhere to the
   `MAJOR.MINOR` format without prefix or suffix, for example `1.0` (and not
   `v1.0`).
5. Push the tag using `git push origin <version>`.

## Publishing a release on [nixpkgs][]

lorri is available in the `nixos-unstable` and release channels starting with
`nixos-19.09`.

lorri is built and tested against `nixos-20.03` in CI, and this is the release
channel targeted for future releases.

The relevant directories and files in [nixpkgs][] are:
- [`pkgs/tools/misc/lorri`][nixpkgs-lorri-tool] declares the command line tool
- [`nixos/modules/services/development/lorri.nix`][nixpkgs-lorri-service]
  declares the systemd module
- [`nixos/tests/lorri`][nixpkgs-lorri-tests] declares the NixOS integration
  test suite

To update the lorri version in [nixpkgs][]:
1. **`nixos-unstable`**: update the lorri version in a PR against `master`, see
   for example [NixOS#77380][nixos-unstable-pr]. Make sure the NixOS
   integration tests pass. You can run them locally from the root directory of
   your nixpkgs clone with `nix-build . -A lorri.tests`. To run them on the
   NixOS infrastructure, post a comment on the PR with the following content:

   > @GrahamcOfBorg build lorri.tests

2. **`nixos-<release>`**: _after_ the first PR has been merged into `master`,
   follow the [backporting procedure][nixpkgs-backporting] to create a PR
   against `release-<release>`; see for example [NixOS#77432][nixos-stable-pr].
   Again, make sure the NixOS integration tests pass (see previous step).

## Updating dependencies

Run `./nix/update-dependencies.sh` from the root directory of this
repository. This updates `nixpkgs.json` to the latest commit of the
`nixos-unstable` channel.

Afterwards, donâ€™t forget to run `nix-shell` and `nix-build` to test
whether everything still builds.

Run `./nix/update-carnix.sh` to update Cargo's dependency list.
